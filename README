# Raw HTTP Get

Project 4: rawhttpget

### Thoughts

For this project, we struggled with consistently ACKing the packets for a while. There would be a big delay in our ACK which would cause the server to retransmit packets and the packet window would never be increased. 

Secondly, we were struggling with the TCP headers for a while. The format and flag specifications were difficult. 

Otherwise, this was just a lot of little adjustments. Constantly. And Wireshark. A lot, a lot of Wireshark. 

rawhttpget / proj4.py - the files that run the rawsockets program, which downloads a given webpage using TCP built from scratch
result.txt - the resulting file from the program
sharkparse.py - returns easily legible results from wireshark pcap files
sniffer.py - sniffs a single incoming TCP packet
